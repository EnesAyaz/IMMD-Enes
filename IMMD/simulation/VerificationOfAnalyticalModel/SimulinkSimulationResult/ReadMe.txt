In this folder, I draw a current waveform of capacitors of 3-phase inverter from
Simulink Model of this with parasitic elements.
The current waverform is CapacitorCurr.mat file.
A matlab script named as dataSaver loads the current waveform and
takes the FFT of this current waveform.
Also, the script save the figures of capacitor currrent in time domain
and FFT analysis.

I observe the carrier harmonics,sideband harmonics.
I do not observe DC, fundamental and baseband harmonics.

Second Harmonic is dominated with respect to others.
